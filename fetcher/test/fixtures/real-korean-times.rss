<![CDATA[ It was 1995 when Nam June Paik (1932-2006) flooded a small, centuries-old baroque church tucked away on the outskirts of Munster, Germany, with a kaleidoscopic laser projection - birthing the installation titled “Baroque Laser.” With all the windows closed, the dark, enclosed chapel and its domed roof became a playground for the visionary creator to explore the potential of lasers as an artistic medium used for projecting 3D images, almost like a spectral hologram - an inconceivable pursuit at the time. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Domestic politics presents major stumbling block to Korea-Japan relations ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ In Korea-Japan relations, it is commonly said among Korean experts that the ball is in Japan's court. In other words, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida holds the key, particularly following his party's big win in the Upper House elections earlier this month. Thus, it's important how he will respond to President Yoon Suk-yeol's repeated calls to sit down for a summit to discuss ways to repair bilateral relations between the two countries. However, some experts disagree with this assessment. They claim that, in fact, the ball is in Korea's court, not Japan's. They say that President Yoon's falling approval rating and the National Assembly being dominated by the main opposition party are some of the stumbling blocks to improving Korea-Japan relations. ]]>

Months of intense protests took place in 2019 against a now-shelved extradition bill, which extended into 2020 as controversy continues over the Beijing-backed national security law. Hong Kong's electoral system also became subject to greater control by the mainland. The COVID-19 pandemic then unfolded, to which the city introduced relentless measures such as flight bans and weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine upon arrival ]]>
